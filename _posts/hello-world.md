lead: There is something so beautiful about a hello world. It's your beginning. The first step in your new journey. It could be a new language, framework, or... maybe a blog. But once you've gotten to the point where you see those words on the screen the possibilities become endless! So here's mine, I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoy dreaming of the possibilities.

Hey!üòä I live in Durham, North Carolina with my girlfriend and two dogs. I enjoy art and I particularly love playing music. In addition to that I'm a collector of hobbies. My newest is woodworking, wish me luck. I suppose having a lot of hobbies is a good thing, because I also kept a hobby of following tech. Which led me to become a full time developer for a tech consulting company. And I'm very grateful to be in that position. Having a wide array of interests seems to be a common thread with developers, we must enjoy trying new things.


So that's why you're here. This is my latest forray into something new. The plan is to make a blog post once a month along with a matching youtube style video. The content will be technical üßê, funny ü§û, and emotionally validating üíú. As a sneak peak here are some of the topics I'm currently writing:

- Building dynamic forms with Formik, NextJS, and TypeScript
- A pattern for simple accessible modals in react
- Building a multi-step form with vanilla Typescript and Vite


Ever since I started learning web development in earnest I've felt an immense gratitude to the dev community, specifically the JavaScript community. They have quite literally given me a means to create a new living for myself and the best way I can think to give back is to help others. In a perfect world my content will guide a junior dev, be a reference for a middle dev, and insightful for senior devs and managers.

I also have some more things I'd like to build on this website. Which is a great time to mention that you can find all this code open source on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jordattebayo/jordattebayo). Some of those features are:
- An accessibility score checker for each page
- A theme picker in blog settings that persists between page refreshes
- And to make a better readme.md for the GitHub repo


Trust me you don't want to miss these gems! Make sure to subscribe in the settings menu (CTRL + SHIFT) and add the rss feed if you use that thang.

Also special thanks to [Travis @souporserious](https://souporserious.com/build-a-dialog-component-in-react/) and to [Sreetam @_SreetamDas](https://sreetamdas.com/blog/rss-for-nextjs) for their helpful posts I referenced building my website. Making this blog would have been much harder with out your help!

Here is reference having an inline image in a blog post because I'll inevitably (sp?) forget.

### The gist:

There is something so beautiful about a hello world application. It's the first step in your new jouney whether it's new language, framework, or even software development in general. Once you have gotten to the point where you print those words on the screen the possibilities are endless! Hey I'm Jordan I do stuff, I like this stuff, 
I want to make something fun, emotionally validating and cross platform. here's why you should listen/read: I'm not sure yet. But I'm making this because I'm grateful to you and want to give back. If you'd like to subscribe for updates feel free to do a cool CTL + SHIFT to bring up the settings menu to subscribe to email alerts. No more than 2 a month and who are am I kidding, probably less. If you're on mobile the subscribe form is at the top of the page. 


### Old Content
Prologue aside I'd really like to use this first post to outline my plans for the future. I mean I have big plans for this blog! Although implementing those plans will take time and I'm quite short on that these days. But you have my word I'll try my best to chip away at it the best I can. Along the way, I'd like to document my journey.
