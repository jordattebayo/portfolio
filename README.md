## Welcome to my portfolio repo
I made this website with NextJS, a React Framework.

Here you can find projects I'm either fond or proud of, heck maybe both. As I clear new hurdles in programming I'll document or implement those ideas here.

Feel free to poke around and let me know what you think!

## To do
In true frontend dev fashion I have began to re-write this app. So there's quite a bit I have to do.. Anyways here are some things I'll try to get to sometime, if you want to follow along.

- Interesting animation to add to header 'jordan booker dot dev'
- Darkmode toggle
- Add information to projects pages
    - logic to disable live site and codebase links if information is missing
- Digital resume
- About me section
